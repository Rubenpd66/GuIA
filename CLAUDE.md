# Sello — Aptis ESOL General prep (unofficial)

Spanish-speaking B1/B2 learners aiming for C in Core, Reading, Listening, Writing and Speaking. Talk to the user in Spanish; code, identifiers and commits in English.

## Rules from the user (non-negotiable)

- Phased work: plan a phase, wait for approval, close it compiling, lint/type clean, tested, committed.
- Ask before installing packages, adding env vars, services or API keys. Never put keys in client code or the repo.
- All study content is ORIGINAL. Imitate the Aptis format, never copy British Council or commercial material. Books (`src/config/books.ts`) are only a coverage index and "Further study" references (book + unit). Extracted book text never enters the repo.
- Never invent official data (score thresholds, etc.).
- Unofficial site: visible non-affiliation notice, no British Council logo, name in branding or corporate colours.
- British English in all English content.
- The user wants no narration or screenshots: work quietly, verify with tests and the validator, report briefly.
- At the end of every phase or batch, add one line recommending the effort level for the next one (high: planning, hard debugging, phase 9 auth/keys; medium: routine code or content; low: mechanical edits).

## Commands

- `npm run check`: typegen + tsc, eslint, vitest, content validator. Run before every commit.
- `npm run validate:content`: Zod + cross-file checks on `content/`, prints book coverage.
- `npx vitest run <path>`: a single test file.
- Dev server: `.claude/launch.json` (`sello-dev`, port 3000).

## Map

- `content/`: JSON, one `kind` per file (`grammar-lessons`, `vocabulary-groups`, `vocabulary`, `exercises`, …). Schemas live in `src/lib/content/schemas/`. Authoring guide: skill `aptis-content`.
- `src/lib/content/`: `load.ts` (cached `getContent()`), `index.ts` (lookups), `validate.ts`, `markup.ts` (`**bold**`, `_italic_`, `==mark==`, gaps `___`), `localize.ts`.
- `src/lib/trainer/`: seeded RNG, session builders, scoring, reducer, exam timings (`config.ts`).
- `src/lib/progress/`: localStorage progress, mistakes bank, export/import.
- `src/app/[locale]/`: pages. `messages/{es,en}.json` must keep identical keys (tested).
- `docs/superpowers/`: spec (`specs/2026-10-18-sello-design.md`) and per-phase plans.

## Next 16 gotchas learned here

- `cacheComponents: true`: every dynamic route needs `generateStaticParams`. `dynamicParams` is unsupported, so read params inside `<Suspense>` and call `notFound()` for unknown ones.
- Server data uses `"use cache"` + `cacheLife("max")` (content only changes on deploy).
- `proxy.ts` replaces middleware. next-intl uses localized `pathnames`, `localeCookie: false`.
- The next-themes "script tag" warning in dev comes from instant validation; it doesn't appear in production.
- Tailwind 4: tokens in `src/app/globals.css` (`@theme inline`, dark mode via `data-theme`). The contrast test parses that file.

## Environment

- Windows. This folder (`~/dev/sello-aptis`) is the working copy. `C:\Users\RUBEN\Documents\sello-aptis` is a mirror protected by Controlled Folder Access: sync it at phase close with PowerShell `git -C "C:\Users\RUBEN\Documents\sello-aptis" pull -q "C:\Users\RUBEN\dev\sello-aptis" main`.
- For bulk content drafting use the `content-writer` agent (Sonnet), then review and validate.
- Code graph: `graphify update .` (local, no API cost) → `graphify-out/`; query with `graphify query "<question>"`.
